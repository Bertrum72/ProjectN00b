I've been inspired by the countless games I've played and I want to get into the nitty-gritty of them. I want to know what makes them work the way they do and how to even create my own someday. So I took HackTX as a learning experience and started to learn some things about the java language, given that it is often the first language for many.
The code attached is for a simple, file input, password checker inspired by UIL computer science. It was really just something to stretch my limits and expand my knowledge in the java langauge.
